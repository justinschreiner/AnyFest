# AnyFest
Justin's Self Guided Project


## Audience
This app is targeted towards music festival attendees who want to make mock-lineups.  Every year there are hundreds of festivals across the world.  Many of these festivals (especially the big ones) have year-round communities which stay in touch.   It's extremely common for these communities to speculate on which acts will perform in the upcoming year.  A popular way to publish these predictions/wish-lists is to create mock-lineups.

## Problem
1. Mock Lineups take a lot of time effort to make from scratch each time.
2. There's no way to quickly and easily reference otherâ€™s predictions while making a mock-lineup.
3. People want mock-lineups to look more similar to the real lineup.

## Solution
Enter AnyFest!  A way to upload templates for mock-lineups which can be used to quickly and easily create mock-lineups.

## Features
#### Templates
* Define sections of the mock-lineup (Ex: days, headliners, sub-headliners, acts, etc.)
* Define style (Ex: text color, delineator, etc.)
#### Data manipulation
* App generates a "people's choice" lineup with the most popular selections from each section filled out
* Users can opt to auto-fill portions of their lineups with others' choices

## Benefits
Making a mock lineup is easier, quicker, and more attractive.  Also, this data could be valuable to festivals
