# Existing user wants to create a Template

## Home Page

From the home page, the user will click a "Create Template" button.

## Select Festival

The user will be given a form with a drop down box to select the festival they are making a template for. If the festival does not exist, they will have the option to add a new festival to the database.

## Create Template Page

The user will be able to upload an image of their blank template. Then, they will be able to drag and drop elements onto their image and fill out a corresponding form. For example, if the template outlines a 4 day festival, the user could drag 4 'day' elements out onto the image. In each 'day' element, they could drag a 'section' element to the top of the day. In a form below, they could define this to be a section for 'headliners'.

The user will be able to adjust global and section-specific settings as well. These settings include font color, delineators, etc.

Once the user is satisfied with their template, they can save it. If needed, they can return to edit it more again later.
